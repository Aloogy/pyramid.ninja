Dependancies:
* Node 8 (specifically, maybe use `NVM` to get the right one)
* Bower

Install Intructions:
* Clone the repo into a lovely folder of your choosing
* Run `npm install` from the source folder to install node modules
* Run `bower install` from the source folder to install bower components
* Run `node server` to start the web server, default port is 3001.
* Navigate to http://localhost:3001 to see pretty things.

This thing is still super alpha, so feel free to submit issues and other fun stuff.
