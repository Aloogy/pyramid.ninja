# Pyramid.Ninja (v2) ðŸ”º
A digital version of the popular drinking game "pyramid". Live version can be found at https://pyramid.ninja.

## How it Works
* Pyramid.ninja is powered by Firebase and uses Firestore to hold values across devices. The host's screen should be seen by all players who join with a random code. Oh, you thought this would explain the actual game? Nah that's a trade secret  ðŸ˜Ž
* Firebase uses anonymous accounts but could be extended with login and history.
* Find out how to play Pyramid the game at https://pyramid.ninja/#!/about
