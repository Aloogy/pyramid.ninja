			Oi. Mate.

			What do you think you're doing here then!? 
			I'll have you know this is very top secret code, only few know of - and when I said "don't go" 
			that wasn't an invitation for you to start nosing around! 
			
			Who do you think you are? 
			
			Do you do this on every website, look for gags in the source. You filthy pest. 
			I should report you, for, uh, misconduct! Or maybe, yes, for just sticking your fingers in too many holes.
			This hole to be precise.
			
			Look, I don't like you, and you don't like me. At least we've got that one straight.
			
			Now go back to your basement dwelling. 
			
			Cu*t.
